# Raindrop
Raindrop is a slick and intuitive, free and open source weather app for the linux terminal!

## Installation

1. Ensure that python3 and pip are installed on your system, most Linux distros come with python3 and pip pre-installed. If your distro does not have python3 and pip installed then you can install it using one of these commands:

APT (Ubuntu, Debian and its associates):
"""
sudo apt install python3-pip
"""
